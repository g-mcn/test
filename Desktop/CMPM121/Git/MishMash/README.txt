Completed: 
	Basic movement
	Unrefined Shooting
Incomplete:
	Punch
	Vacuum
	Grab

The three incomplete player functions are unfinished due to failures regarding time management. I think they should still be straightforward enough to take care of within a reasonable time frame and with enough time to take care of basic enemy function before the next deadline.
